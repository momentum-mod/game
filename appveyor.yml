# It's important to note that this is what is found inside of createallprojects.bat, but our script pauses
# to help know if something went wrong with VPC, so we directly call it here instead.
# Further note: Our builder builds everything, including tools, because we require them for our push to Steam.
# It is advised to just only build your game projects (server/client DLLs). Replace this line with the commands found in
# your "creategameprojects.bat" file in your repository.
# CHANGEME
  - devtools\bin\vpc.exe /momentum +everything /mksln everything.sln

# Another note: VPC is really lame and doesn't spit out the full solution file. The correct file is after you
# open it in Visual Studio and save it. There's a big chunk missing at the end. Refer to momentum's "sln_fix.txt" file,
# or push your sln file to your game's repository. You can see how the sln_file got its chunk by opening your project's sln
# file inside of a text editor and looking near the bottom of the file. We copy that chunk over here.
