> Momentum Mod is a free, standalone game built on the Source Engine centralizing the major movement gametypes found in games like Counter-Strike, Half-Life, Team Fortress, and Titanfall.

## What is this?

This is a **VERY WIP** fork of momentum mod where KZ players can test different game mechanics and will hopefully help decide what will eventually be in the real Climb gamemode in Momentum Mod!

## How do I install this???

1. Download and install the 0.8.7 public build of Momentum Mod from here: https://github.com/momentum-mod/game/releases/tag/0.8.7-public-eval
2. Download the latest release of Momentum-KZ from here: https://github.com/GameChaos/momentum-kz/releases
3. Extract Momentum-KZ-XXXX-XX-XX.zip into the root of your 0.8.7 installation folder (same folder where hl2.exe is).
4. Extract Momentum-KZ-Maps-XXXX-XX-XX.zip into the maps/ folder.

If you want to fiddle with some commands like sv_airaccelerate, then add `-mapping` as a launch option to run_momentum.bat.

## Other Info

If you need any help, then @GameChaos#8192 (that's me!) in the #general-climb channel in the [Momentum Mod Discord](https://discord.gg/n4v52uv), or PM me.

Maps that are included in Momentum-KZ-Maps-XXXX-XX-XX.zip:
- kz_100_metres - Similar to `100m` in Quake 1. Bhop in a straight line to get the best time.
- kz_bkz_goldbhop_bad_port - A quick and dirty port of bkz_goldbhop for gameplay testing.
- kz_checkmate_bad_port - A quick and dirty port of kz_checkmate for gameplay testing.
- kz_xc_nature - CSS map made by chichin: https://gamebanana.com/mods/123762
- kz_gc_ladder_test - A WIP map by me for testing ladders.

Basic things that I've changed from the original 0.8.7 Climb mode:

**Disclaimer! Not all of these are set in stone!**

- Changed tickrate to 128.
- sv_maxspeed is 250.
- sv_stopspeed is 80 to match CS:GO.
- sv_considered_on_ground changed to 2 for ledgegrabs.
- Changed ducking code to more closely match CS:GO.
- Changed the player collision size to match CS:GO.
- Changed jump height to be independent from tickrate (default jump height is now 57 or 66 when crouched), also set sv_jump_z_offset to 0.
- Ground speed is capped to maxspeed **once** after `sv_kz_bhop_grace_ticks` to 250 or 85 if ducking.
- Fixed airaccel bug that scaled airaccel by 0.25x in the middle of your jump.

## Useful commands for players that are used to KZ.

- `mom_hud_menu_show savelocmenu` - A teleport menu similar to KZTimer's and GOKZ's, except you can set a checkpoint anywhere and it preserves your speed.

## KZ Commands that change KZ game mechanics:

### Algorithm of `sv_kz_bhop_cap_1...` (sv_kz_bhop_cap_type 1):

landingSpeed is the horizontal speed that the player had on their first tick of landing.

newSpeed is what their horizontal speed will be after jumping.

```
if landingSpeed > sv_kz_bhop_cap_1_max_start, then
{
	newSpeed = sv_kz_bhop_cap_1_max_start
	if landingSpeed > sv_kz_bhop_cap_1_multiplier_start, then
	{
		newSpeed = newSpeed + (landingSpeed - sv_kz_bhop_cap_1_multiplier_start) * sv_kz_bhop_cap_1_multiplier;
		if newSpeed < sv_kz_bhop_cap_1_min_end, then newSpeed = sv_kz_bhop_cap_1_min_end
		if newSpeed > sv_kz_bhop_cap_1_max_end, then newSpeed = sv_kz_bhop_cap_1_max_end
	}
}
```

Some examples with the default convar settings:

If landingSpeed is 310, then newSpeed will be 310.

If landingSpeed is 340, then newSpeed will be 315.

If landingSpeed is 370, then newSpeed will be 300.

If landingSpeed is 600, then newSpeed will be 275.
