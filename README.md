> Momentum Mod is a free, standalone game built on the Source Engine centralizing the major movement gametypes found in games like ~~Counter-Strike, Half-Life, Team Fortress, and Titanfall~~ only Quake 3 Defrag matters.

## Defrag best mode??

This is my modification of Momentum Mod 0.8.7 to include more accurate Quake 3 / CPMA movement. It uses a completely rewritten player movement code based on the original Quake 3 GPL source. These are just some of its features:

* Accurate Q3 ground movement
* Quake-like jump inputs (buffered)
* VQ3 and CPMA airacceleration/aircontrol
* VQ3 and CPMA airstepping
* VQ3 swimming
* CPMA trimping
* Wallclipping
* CPMA double jumps
* Acceleration penalty for holding jump too long
* Quake 3 weapons (currently the rocket launcher, grenade launcher, and plasma gun)
* Differential strafing mode
* Velocity snapping
* Slick surfaces (via trigger_momentum_slide)
* QW and Q2 rampsliding
* Q2 additive jumps
* Customizable physics that can mix features from different games

There are currently many missing features, mainly involving weapons and powerups.
