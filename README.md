> Momentum Mod is a free, standalone game built on the Source Engine centralizing the major movement gametypes found in games like ~~Counter-Strike, Half-Life, Team Fortress, and Titanfall~~ only Quake 3 Defrag (and some other games) matter.

## Defrag best mode??

This is my modification of Momentum Mod 0.8.7 to include more accurate Quake 3 / CPM movement. It uses a completely rewritten player movement code based on the original Quake 3 GPL source. More information can be found at the forum post here: [Lumia's Defrag Mod General Thread](https://forum.momentum-mod.org/d/71-lumias-defrag-mod-general-thread)

This mod also includes some extra neat things, including a recreation of the Beggar's Bazooka and demoman shield charging ("trimping.") See the end of the included README for more information.

## Installation

First, download the latest public release of Momentum Mod 0.8.7 here: [0.8.7 Public Evaluation Build](https://github.com/momentum-mod/game/releases/tag/0.8.7-public-eval)

To install, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/chovelyoukai/defragmmod/releases) and get the zip file from the latest release (you may need to click "assets" to see all the files.)

From there, unzip the Defrag zip file into your Momentum Mod folder and play the game! If something doesn't work, check the README included with the mod for more instructions.
