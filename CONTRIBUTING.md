# About contributing
Contributing to the mod is very easy. Just fork the repo, make your desired changes
and then send us a pull request and we'll happly revise it. Once your first pull request
is approved, you can ask us to invite you to the Momentum Development Team, so you can
help us further (But it's not necessary, and if you ask us we'll very happy invite you either
way even if you didn't submit a pull request!)


When contributing, don't forget to add yourself to [sp/game/momentum/scripts/credits.txt](sp/game/momentum/scripts/credits.txt)
under *Contributors* (You can find instructions of how-to inside said file)

**Every help we can get is welcomed**


Also, *as this is a Soruce mod*, VALVe's contributing conditions apply here as well:


*As a condition of providing a Contribution, you agree that:* 
- *You grant Valve a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license
to make, use, sell, reproduce, modify, distribute (directly and indirectly),
and publicly display and perform the Contribution, and any derivative works
that Valve may make from the Contribution, under any intellectual property you
own or have the right to license.* 
- *You warrant and represent that the Contribution is your original creation,
that you have the authority to grant this license to Valve, and that this
license does not require the permission of any third party.  Otherwise, you
provide your Contribution "as is" without warranties.*

*Should you wish to submit a suggestion or work that is not your original
creation, you may submit it to Valve separate from any Contribution,
explicitly identifying it as sourced from a third party, stating the details
of its origin, and informing Valve of any license or other restriction of
which you are personally aware.*
