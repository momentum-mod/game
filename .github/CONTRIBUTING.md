# Contributing
Contributing to this project is easy and straightforward. Just fork the repo, branch off of the develop branch, make your desired changes,
and then send us a pull request and we'll happily revise it!

Note: We use Hungarian Notation (Systems), spaces instead of tabs, and ClangFormat for any custom file added to the project.

If your work is to be used in our project, we will credit you with a Contributor role on [our credits page.](https://momentum-mod.org/#credits) If you wish to have a certain name in this credit, make sure to mention it in the comments of your Pull Request, otherwise, we'll just use your GitHub username.

If we like your work enough, we may invite you to be on the team!

If you have any other concerns, feel free to [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/V4gS7Qg) and chat with us!

**We welcome all the help we can get!**
