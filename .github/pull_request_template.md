### Checklist
- [ ] If there is a localization token change, I have updated the `momentum_english_ref.res` file with the changes, ran `tokenizer.py` to generate an up-to-date localization file, and have committed both the `.res` file changes and the new localization `.txt` file
- [ ] If I introduced new h/cpp files, I have added them to the appropriate project's VPC file (`server_momentum.vpc` / `client_momentum.vpc` / etc)
- [ ] My commits are relatively small and scoped to the best of my ability
- [ ] My branch has a clear history of changes that can be easy to follow when being reviewed commit-by-commit
- [ ] My branch is functionally complete; the only changes to be done will be those potentially requested in code review
